	abstract = {Fruitful ideas on how to quantize gravity are few and far between. In this paper, we give a complete description of a recently introduced non-perturbative gravitational path integral whose continuum limit has already been investigated extensively in d less than 4, with promising results. It is based on a simplicial regularization of Lorentzian space-times and, most importantly, possesses a well-defined, non-perturbative Wick rotation. We present a detailed analysis of the geometric and mathematical properties of the discretized model in d=3,4. This includes a derivation of Lorentzian simplicial manifold constraints, the gravitational actions and their Wick rotation. We define a transfer matrix for the system and show that it leads to a well-defined self-adjoint Hamiltonian. In view of numerical simulations, we also suggest sets of Lorentzian Monte Carlo moves. We demonstrate that certain pathological phases found previously in Euclidean models of dynamical triangulations cannot be realized in the Lorentzian case.},

Unfortunately, that understanding is con- fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex- haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

In this paper we study transformations of simplicial p.l. manifolds by elementary boundary operations (shellings and inverse shellings). As the main result we shall show that a simplicial p.l. manifold M can be transformed to any other simplical p.l. manifold M homeomorphic to M using these elementary operations.

After fine-tuning the cosmological constant to its critical value, we find a whole range of the gravitational coupling constant \$k\_0\$ for which the functional integral is dominated by non-degenerate three-dimensional space-times. We therefore have a situation in which a well-defined ground state of extended geometry is generated dynamically from a non-perturbative state sum of fluctuating geometries. Remarkably, its macroscopic scaling properties resemble those of a semi-classical spherical universe. Measurements so far indicate that \$k\_0\$ defines an overall scale in this extended phase, without affecting the physics of the continuum limit.

Wick rotation, (ii) possessing a coordinate-invariant cutoff, and (iii) leading to
convergent sums over geometries. Although little is known as yet about the existence
and nature of an underlying continuum theory of quantum gravity in four dimensions,
there are already a number of beautiful results in d = 2 and d = 3 where continuum
limits have been found. They include an explicit example of the inequivalence of
the Euclidean and Lorentzian path integrals, a non-perturbative mechanism for the
cancellation of the conformal factor, and the discovery that causality can act as an
effective regulator of quantum geometry.},

The presented algorithm can be easily generalized to higher dimensions and arbitrary trap geometry. For truncated Wigner simulations the quantum noise can be added with conventional methods (half a quantum of energy in every mode). The advantage of the presented method over the usual analytical and stochastic ones lies in its ability to sample not only from canonical and grand canonical distributions, but also from the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which can help to shed new light on thermodynamics of integrable systems.},

	abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

We show that when this condition is not met the limiting process of the algorithm is altered, yielding an asymptotically optimal acceptance rate which might drastically diﬀer from the usual 0.234. In particular, we prove that as d → ∞ the sequence of stochastic processes formed by say the i∗-th component of each Markov chain usually converges to a Langevin diﬀusion process with a distinct speed measure, except in particular cases where it converges to a one-dimensional Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a singular acceptance rule. We also discuss the use of inhomogeneous proposals, which might reveal essential in speciﬁc cases.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new scalable parallelization scheme to generate the 3D Delaunay triangulation of a given set of points. Our first contribution is an efficient serial implementation of the incremental Delaunay insertion algorithm. A simple dedicated data structure and a number of improvements in the insertion algorithm have permitted to accelerate by a factor three reference implementations. Our second contribution is a multi-threaded version of the Delaunay kernel able to concurrently insert vertices. Moore curve coordinates are used to partition the point set, avoiding so heavy synchronization overheads. Conflicts are managed by modification of the partition with a simple rescaling of the space-filling curve. The performances of our implementation have been measured on three different processors, Intel core-i7, Intel Xeon Phi and AMD EPYC, on which we have been able to compute 3 billion tetrahedra in 53 seconds . This corresponds to a generation rate of over 55 million tetrahedra per second which is, to our best knowledge, three times the rate reached by the current fastest implementation. It is finally shown how this very efficient parallel Delaunay triangulation can be integrated in a Delaunay refinement mesh generator taking as input the boundary of the domain to mesh.},
