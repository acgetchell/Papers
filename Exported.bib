	abstract = {The relation between Regge's equations of motion for a simplicial manifold and the distributional Einstein tensor of the manifold is discussed. Regge's equations imply that the distributional Einstein tensor vanishes 'on average', the averaging involving integrating contributions to the Einstein tensor on a suitably defined 3-surface.},
