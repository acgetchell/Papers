	abstract = {A well-defined regularized path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity in three and four dimensions is constructed, given in terms of a sum over dynamically triangulated causal space-times. Each Lorentzian geometry and its associated action have a unique Wick rotation to the Euclidean sector. All space-time histories possess a distinguished notion of a discrete proper time. For finite lattice volume, the associated transfer matrix is self-adjoint and bounded. The reflection positivity of the model ensures the existence of a well-defined Hamiltonian. The degenerate geometric phases found previously in dynamically triangulated Euclidean gravity are not present. The phase structure of the new Lorentzian quantum gravity model can be readily investigated by both analytic and numerical methods.},

	abstract = {The Causal Dynamical Triangulation ({CDT)} approach to quantum gravity is a lattice approximation to the gravitational path integral. Developed by Ambj{\textbackslash}o\{\}rn, Jurkiewicz and Loll, it has yielded some important results, notably the emergence of classical spacetime and short scale dimensional reduction. However, virtually all the results reported so far have been based on a single computer code. In this paper we present the first completely independent verification of the {CDT} algorithm, and report the successful reproduction of the emergence of classical spacetime and smooth reduction in the spectral dimension of the 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional spacetimes.},

This check goes well beyond verifications of the Newtonian limit based on considerations of "test particles", since arbitrarily strong self-fields are not excluded for either object. It is also an explicit verification of the equality of active and passive gravitational masses.},

After emphasizing the strictly nonperturbative nature of this semiclassical limit we present a detailed study of the three-volume data, which allows us to re-confirm the de Sitter structure, exhibit short-distance discretization effects, and make a first detailed investigation of the presence of higher-order curvature terms in the effective action for the scale factor. Technically, we make use of a novel way of fixing the total four-volume in the simulations.},
